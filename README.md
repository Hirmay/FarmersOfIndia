This is a Project made for the convinience of farmers of india.
My country is India which is a developing country so naturally it is an agriculture country where it is the main source of livelihood for 80% of the population of rural India.
Also every day atleast 10 farmers commit suicide most due to monetary reasons.
I have made this project so that farmers can know the basics of how to grow, get market prices of vegetables, get simulation of loan system (Generalized) and
corresponding debts to be paid.
